# Meet The Team 👋

Say hello to our lovely team of programmers working hard to make your gym experience amazing!

### 😎 Amusat Farouk

Amusat is a third-year computer science student at the University of Manitoba with a strong interest in backend development and software testing. He contributed to the architectural diagram, vision statement, and implemented the transition from basic stubs to an HSQLDB-backed persistence layer. Amusat worked extensively on unit, integration, and system tests using JUnit, Mockito, and Espresso. He strengthened his skills in version control with Git and gained experience in structured, collaborative development while ensuring the app’s reliability and maintainability.

### 🫠 Evan Kowalchuk

Evan is a third-year computer science student at the University of Manitoba who specialized in working on the app's front end development. His knowledge with HCI helped direct the team in the design of the various screens and how they should look, implementing navigation between the screens, and created custom exercise images for workouts. As the project progressed, Evan expanded his role to include unit testing using JUnit and Mockito, ensuring proper code coverage. Through the project, he grew more confident in Android development, and strengthened his ability to transform design concepts into polished, functional features through effective teamwork.

### 👾 Logan Furedi

Logan is a third-year computer science student at the University of Manitoba. Logan's strengths were in catching poor practices, creating structure within the team, and developing the workout builder and playback screens. He had a strong influence in the decision-making process relating to the database schema and the overall architecture of the project. Over the course of the project, Logan gained confidence in articulating his ideas, learned a structured and flexible application architecture, and became well-acquainted with Android Studio. He also gained practical experience developing tests using JUnit, Mockito, and Expresso.

### 🐉 Ramatjyot Singh

Ramatjyot played a key role in the project's development, contributing to both technical implementation and overall structure. He worked on designing and implementing core features, including the exercise list and detail views, while also addressing integration challenges. As the project progressed, he shifted focus to improving code quality, fixing bugs, and refining the architecture for better maintainability. His contributions extended to database management, writing integration tests, and documenting the system to ensure long-term usability. Through his efforts, he helped enhance both functionality and stability, gaining valuable experience in clean coding, structured development, and project collaboration.

### 🪱 Ty Paragas

Ty is a third-year computer science student at the University of Manitoba who focused on Android development and testing. He implemented core UI features, helped design user flows, and contributed to system functionality across multiple iterations. He wrote unit and UI tests using JUnit and Espresso, and worked within an Agile workflow to plan, review, and iterate on features. Through this project, Ty deepened his understanding of Android Studio, refined his teamwork and communication skills, and gained hands-on experience in mobile software development and test-driven design.
